# Best Practices for Inclusive Image Generation

### For Users generating images
- Use specificity when creating a prompt: be as descriptive as possible in your prompt writing. Models struggle with consistent output when provided with vaguely defined asks (e.g. "person in a shop" vs. "a person in a coffee shop buying a drink"). 
- Avoid euphemisms, idioms, and other colloquial phrases

### For AI Researchers, Engineers, and Product Teams building image generators
- Prioritize intersectionality in training: to properly guide the models in understanding the nuance of different identities, it's important to have a variety of representation of the category. For example, when generating images of Blind and Low Vision users, the training data should include diversity of age, gender, and race on top of different representations of vision disabilities.
